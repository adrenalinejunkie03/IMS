# IMS

This is an Inventory Management System, desktop project based on .NET developed on Visual Studio combined with SSMS(SQL-Server Management Studio) as Database and SQL(SQL-Server) for local or remote connection.
This project is basically for university but can be used for small businesses or store owners to manage their inventory and even get a print for their invoice or return sales through the efficient implementation of SAP to generate the reports..

The code will be provided, you may need to make some changes fiest in order to make it useful for you, as there needs to be an installation of SQL-Server and key is generated on first use which authenticates the user and stores the username and password for login..

Enjoy the software :)
